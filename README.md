My personal website was created on Hugo. Though it is an amazing tech and the speed which you can build is awesome, but it sometime feels very limiting. Given that I do not have much knowledge on the underlying language Go. I picked Hugo, purely based on the fact that I wanted to get started as quick as possible. I wanted to reach out to the world and get myself visible. I think I have done a fair enough job to start with. I did try few latest tech at the moment but the learning curve made me stick to the one I finally chose to use. 

I am currently working on converting my website from Hugo to NextJs. The NextJs has been an exceptional tool in the current web development world. It offers a lot of functionality which you'd want during your web development. It brings lot of additional functionality the dev community was expecting from React for ever. Thanks to NextJs, it is so much joy of web development. Cheers to the maker, Vercel, amazing company. I love their products. 

Back to what I;m doing right now. Here is the high level requirement I am working on and the Tech-stack: 

NextJs, Firebase for Authentication, Storage, Database, Nelify Functions for few secure api calls, Spotify api, twitter api, instagram api, github api, Notion api, airtable api

Wwill keep updating this page.

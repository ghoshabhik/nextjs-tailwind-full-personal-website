                    <p className="mb-10">Its not so long ago I started with long run. The city has its effect on me, I
                        guess. At work, I met many of my collegues and friends, who are pro marathon runners. I was so
                        inspired looking at their passion towards running that I decided to give it a try. I did run
                        before but not with the goal of loving to run. I&apos;m still building on my techniques but I love
                        the fact that I enjoy running. Specially runnning early in the morning has a calming effect
                        throughout the day. I have participated in several half marathons in Mumbai, India. Hoping to
                        get qualified for my first 42.6KM in next TMM and then someday in the future - NYC marathon ðŸ™‚.
                    </p>
                    <p className="">
                        So thats runnning, but I find a great deal of happiness in photography too. I feel,
                        photography is an emotional expression of an individual. You see more intensive red colors after
                        drinking coffee - thats science but you cannot see colors like Eliot Porter(who by the way,
                        known to be the first man in american arts to shoot color photos in 1938 ), so thats art. To me,
                        photography is a way to reflect yourself. Its so amazing, so liberating. During my stay in
                        Seattle, WA, I met so many passionate photographers - by the dark lake at midnight waiting for
                        the glimpse of our milky way galaxy, lugging huge weight on the way up to mountain in search for
                        a perfect landscape shot, ignoring snow, ice, rain to see the city when it rains. Ansel Adam,
                        Michael Malford and there are many more who inspired the world to create art through
                        photography. I dont know, whether I create art or snapshots. But I love my photography.ðŸ™‚

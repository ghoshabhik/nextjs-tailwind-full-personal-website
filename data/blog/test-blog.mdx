## The Old Way

My old process consisted of two main sources: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). I'm sure most people know what Reddit is by now, given that it's the 3rd most visited website in the US. Hacker News is a stripped back Reddit-like aggregator ran by [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) specifically targeted at the tech industry. Users can upvote interesting content which makes it more discoverable to others. Simple as that.

I'd check these websites dailfsdf
- There was no shared history across both sources. Sure, Reddit has a view history and HN has an upvote history, but there's no single source of truth. This problem exacerbates itself when adding another source into the mix (e.g. NY Times).
- My bookmarks were flooded with articles I wanted to save forever or read later. This list was starting to get out of hand (and again, not a single source of truth).
- I wanted to consume more content sources, specifically news sites, without having to check 4-5 websites daily.
- Lots of news sites have poorly designed interfaces filled with cruft. Your adblocker can only do so much. It doesn't surpass a paywall or improve the page layout.

## The New Way

I was able to solve the aforementioned issues using a combination of Feedly and Instapaper. Let's talk about these both individually.

### Feedly

```js
import db from '../../lib/db-admin';

export default (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.id) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: 'Missing "id" query parameter'
    });
  }

  const ref = db.ref('table').child(req.query.id);

  return ref.once('value', (snapshot) => {
    res.status(200).json({
      total: snapshot.val()
    });
  });
};
```

```js
// lib/db-admin.js

const admin = require('firebase-admin');

try {
  admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert({
      client_email: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,
      private_key: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY,
      project_id: 'your-project-id'
    }),
    databaseURL: 'https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com'
  });
} catch (error) {
  /*
   * We skip the "already exists" message which is
   * not an actual error when we're hot-reloading.
   */
  if (!/already exists/u.test(error.message)) {
    console.error('Firebase admin initialization error', error.stack);
  }
}

module.exports = admin.database();
```
